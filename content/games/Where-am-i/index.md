### Game Description
Where am i?
Is a 3D horror / mysterygame where you are trapped in a basement.
Try to escape anyway you can!

### What i did
During this project, I focused on learning ScriptableObjects to enhance game dynamics and interactivity.
I dedicated time to refining the interaction system,
ensuring that timing and sound effects significantly contribute to the immersive experience.

### Info
Sound: Melodic Mayhem, Freesounds and some 3d objects made by winsbo.
